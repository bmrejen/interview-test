# Phoceis Technical Test

#### Objective
Develop a mobile web page displaying a list of stores, their information and allowing to edit the list.
You have an ```index.html``` page ready to use that imports Boostrap CSS and Bootstrap JS. You should extensively use
Bootstrap easy tools for this test.

For serving the page, just run the ```serve .``` command from the terminal in the project's root and connect to
[this page](http://localhost:5000).

#### Used Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

### 1 - Create a stores' list

Load all the stores contained in the ```starbucks_new_york.json``` file and display them in a list.

### 2 - Display store's information in a dialog

When clicking a store in the list, its information is displayed in a dialog. The dialog should be a Bootstrap modal.

### 3 - Edit the list

Make it possible to delete a store from the list, with a prior warning. A Bootstrap alert should display after deleting a row.
No need to make it deleted from the JSON file (if the page is refreshed, all the list resets).

### 4 - Edit a store

Make it possible to edit a store so we can change its name, address and City.
No need to make it deleted from the JSON file (if the page is refreshed, all the list resets).
